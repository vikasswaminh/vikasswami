    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">India’s Exponential Growth Story</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      India is entering a decade of unstoppable growth — driven by Internet access, AI adoption, and digital transformation across every sector. From education to manufacturing, agriculture to health care, technology is now at the center of everything.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      As the world’s fastest-growing Internet market, India’s economy will rely heavily on those who can build and maintain efficient IT infrastructure. Experts who can help companies, colleges, and public institutions save massive costs through smarter network design will be the ones creating wealth.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Networkers Home — Leading the Infrastructure Revolution</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Networkers Home, with over 25 years of deep expertise in Networking and Network Security, is positioning itself ahead of this transformation. Our new IT division is partnering with over <strong>50+ of the world’s most remarkable companies</strong> — including Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco, and others — while building India’s largest <strong>discount store for IT solutions</strong>, serving partners and distributors nationwide.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-purple-50 rounded-2xl p-6 mb-6">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-3">Make in India. For the World.</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Our long-term vision is to design and manufacture Indian networking products — Wi-Fi access points, routers, switches, firewalls, ZTNA devices, and open-source-powered appliances. These will lower costs for schools, colleges, and SMEs by up to <strong>70%</strong> while matching or exceeding global standards.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
        Consider this: a Cisco and an Aruba switch can differ in price by almost 50%, yet performance reviews often favor Aruba. India, a price-sensitive market, deserves that kind of smart choice — built locally and supported globally.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      This vision is led by <strong>Mr. Vikas Swami</strong> — a dual CCIE expert with unmatched multi-vendor and multi-cloud experience. His background spans over three decades in C, C++, and kernel-level development, along with cloud mastery across OpenNebula, MicroCloud, and every major public cloud.  
      It’s a rare combination of <em>hardware depth, software skill, and business leadership</em> that drives the NH product roadmap.

  <!-- Section: Partner & Entrepreneurship Model -->
  <section class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-12 bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-md mb-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Empowering Students as Partners & Entrepreneurs</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Every student at Networkers Home is encouraged to think beyond jobs. While we support placements across top global IT companies, we also prepare students to take their experience and create opportunities in their own cities.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      India has over <strong>500 major cities</strong> — each ready for digital expansion. NH students can become <strong>Authorised Silver and Gold Partners</strong> in their local regions at <strong>zero joining fee</strong>. These partners will represent Networkers Home’s ecosystem and collaborate directly with our 50+ technology partners.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-emerald-50 rounded-2xl p-6 mb-6">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-3">The Model</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>Students first gain hands-on experience through NH training and internships.</li>
        <li>They then represent NH in their city — serving local schools, colleges, and businesses with cost-effective IT and networking solutions.</li>
        <li>As they grow, they gain access to joint projects, mentorship, and future co-ownership opportunities within NH’s new ventures.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      The goal is simple — create a nationwide community of NH-trained professionals who lead digital transformation from the ground up.  
      Entrepreneurship taught not as theory, but as lived experience.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Building for a Connected Future</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      As every home, office, and shop goes online, India will see new models of Internet access and sharing. We envision even small stores and tea shops selling Wi-Fi vouchers — ₹20 for an hour of high-speed 1 Gbps Internet — supporting students, professionals, and gig workers across the country.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Networkers Home is building the technologies and training behind this — from intelligent routers and edge firewalls to AI-powered network management systems. The mission is to make <strong>secure connectivity affordable and universal</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      By combining hardware design, software innovation, and nationwide mentorship, NH aims to become India’s first truly integrated networking products and education company — rooted in Indian expertise, but designed for global impact.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-extrabold mb-4">Mentor’s Message to Students</h2>
    <p class="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The future will not wait for big companies to decide what jobs remain. The next era belongs to builders — people who understand networks, automation, and AI deeply enough to design solutions that save time and money for others.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      As AI takes over routine tasks, the power shifts to those who can make systems talk to each other — securely, efficiently, and affordably. That is where Networkers Home students will lead.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white font-semibold text-lg mt-6">
      <em>Let’s build the Internet of India — one city, one idea, one entrepreneur at a time.</em>
